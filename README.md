# Learn how to master Prompt Engineering, and utilize the Orchestration Service of SAP AI Launchpad

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/codejam-ai-prompt-engineering-and-orchestration)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/codejam-ai-prompt-engineering-and-orchestration)

## Description
This CodeJam is special in a sense that you won't write any code but you will work a lot with LLMs and the SAP AI Launchpad. The goal of this CodeJam is that you learn everything about Prompt Engineering, the fundamentals of AI and finally configure an Orchestration Workflow to build a Retrieval Augmented Generation flow.

The contextual data is stored in a S3 Bucket on AWS initialized through a content bucket on SAP Business Technology Platform.

## Exercises

These are the exercises, each in their directory, sometimes with supporting files and scripts. We will work through the exercises in the order shown here. From a session flow perspective, we are taking the "coordinated" approach:

1. [Exercise 00 - Introduction to Prompt Engineering](./exercises/00-prompt-engineering-with-ai-launchpad/readme.md)
2. [Exercise 01 - Create a Prompt Template with the SAP AI Launchpad](./exercises/01-create-prompt-template/readme.md)
3. [Exercise 02 - Set up an orchestration pipeline with the SAP AI Launchpad](./exercises/02-setup-orchestration-pipeline/readme.md)
4. [Exercise 03 - Learn More About Data Masking](./exercises/03-orchestration-test-anonymization-pseudonymization/readme.md)
5. [Exercise 04 - Learn More About Content Filtering](./exercises/04-orchestration-test-input-output-filtering/readme.md)

The instructor will start you on the first exercise, and that's the only one you should do. You should only proceed to the next exercise once the instructor tells you to.

For this CodeJam you are provided with a subaccount on SAP BTP. The subaccount is only available for the duration of this CodeJam.
